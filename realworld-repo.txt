This malware is designed to intercept and manipulate cryptocurrency transactions. It operates by monitoring the system clipboard and silently replacing copied wallet addresses with those controlled by an attacker. When a victim pastes what they believe to be their intended address, the transaction is redirected elsewhere—often permanently.
